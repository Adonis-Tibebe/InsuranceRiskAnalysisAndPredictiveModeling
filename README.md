# Insurance Risk Analysis and Predictive Modeling

This project provides tools and analysis for understanding insurance portfolio risk and supporting predictive modeling.

## Structure

- **notebooks/**  
  Contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA), including data cleaning, risk profiling, and visualization.

- **src/**  
  Source code modules with reusable functions for data processing, cleaning, and plotting.

- **tests/**  
  Unit tests for validating the core data processing and analysis functions.

- **Data/**  
  (Not included in version control) Directory for raw and cleaned datasets used in analysis.

## Key Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing for insurance datasets
- Loss ratio analysis by province, vehicle type, and gender
- Distribution and outlier analysis of key financial variables
- Temporal and segment-based claim analysis
- Visualizations for risk assessment and business insights
- Modular code and unit tests for reliability

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
2. Place your data files in the `Data/` directory.
3. Explore the analysis in `notebooks/EDA_analysis.ipynb`.
4. Run unit tests from the `tests/` directory:

   ```sh
   python -m unittest discover tests
   ```

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- See `requirements.txt` for package dependencies.

## Notes

- Data files are not included in this repository.
- The project is organized for modularity and future extension.
